(1, 'Luka Doncic vs. Deandre Ayton is the draft‚Äôs great debate', 'We‚Äôre just three weeks from the 2018 NBA Draft. The Phoenix Suns are on the clock with the No. 1 pick, and they‚Äôre expected to chose between Arizona center Deandre Ayton and Slovenian teen prodigy Luka Doncic.\r\n\r\nThe debate at the top of the draft offers a lens into the type of player teams will value as the NBA game continues to evolve. Ayton is the type of dominant center that would have been a no-brainer top pick for much of the league‚Äôs history, but he‚Äôs entering the pro game at a time when traditional centers are becoming marginalized, particularly when they struggle on the defensive end.\r\n\r\nDoncic isn‚Äôt the type of pure athlete that typically goes No. 1 overall, but his skill level is so advanced and his production is so impressive that he‚Äôs turned himself into a worthy candidate.\r\n\r\nWhat will Phoenix do? We‚Äôll know soon enough. \r\n\r\n<h3> 1. Phoenix Suns - Luka Doncic, G, Slovenia </h3>\r\n\r\nWe‚Äôve had Doncic at No. 1 on our board since last June, and we‚Äôre not changing it until there‚Äôs real confirmation Phoenix is going in another direction. Ayton remains the popular choice in most mocks to go No. 1, but there‚Äôs still reason to believe Doncic could be the pick. For one: the Suns made an outside-the-box coaching hire with Igor Kokoskov this summer, who coached Doncic to a gold medal with Slovenia at EuroBasket. Phoenix will be more familiar with Doncic‚Äôs game than any other team in the lottery.\r\n</br> </br>\r\nDoncic is also a great fit around Phoenix‚Äôs existing roster. He would give the Suns an offensive initiator who could play well off Devin Booker. Doncic‚Äôs box score numbers might never look as eye-catching as Ayton‚Äôs, but there‚Äôs a good argument to made that his all-around game is simply more conducive to helping win games. \r\n\r\n<h3> 2. Sacramento Kings - Deandre Ayton, C, Arizona </h3>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/y6j4Mr-Q9tY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n</br></br>\r\n\r\nAyton being available at No. 2 is a dream scenario for a Kings team that has been looking for the next face of the franchise since trading DeMarcus Cousins. Like Boogie, Ayton is a supremely gifted 7-footer who can score with his back to the basket or with a face-up jumper while dominating the glass. The defensive concerns with Ayton are real. He simply didn‚Äôt show good instincts during his one year at Arizona. That said, his combination of size and explosiveness is as good as any player to come through the draft this decade. He has every physical tool necessary to become a star.', 'assets/posts/post-img-1.png', '2018-06-12 17:44:16', 1, 16),
(3, 'Suns reportedly want to bring in Trae Young for workout', 'The Suns have the No. 1 overall pick in the 2018 NBA Draft, and it seems very likely they\'re going to take Deandre Ayton with that pick. They also have another pick in the first round at No. 16. This gives the Suns a lot of options on how to approach the draft. One of those options is trading their second first-rounder. </br>\r\n\r\nAccording to Jonathan Wasserman of Bleacher Report, Phoenix is trying to bring in Oklahoma guard Trae Young for a workout. Young probably isn\'t going No. 1 overall, but somewhere in the top 10 sounds far more likely. Could the Suns be doing their homework on Young because they\'re looking to move up and add him to their extremely young core? </br> </br>\r\n\r\nYoung and Ayton together, along with Josh Jackson and Devin Booker, would give the Suns a young core to build around. There\'s a lot to be excited about there. They would need to give up a young asset of some kind to move up for Young, but Booker and Jackson are probably as close to untouchable as it gets for the Suns.\r\n\r\nThe question is what are the Suns willing to give up to take Young. Are they hoping to offload a veteran like Tyson Chandler, or will they be willing to move an asset such as Dragan Bender? There\'s also the question of what teams are willing to move back in the draft. The Magic, a common Trae Young destination in mock drafts, could be a possibility. If Orlando isn\'t thrilled with Young then the Magic could take him, make a deal with Phoenix on draft night, and then move back in the draft to make a pick at No. 16 instead.', 'assets/posts/post-img-2.jpg', '2018-06-14 18:26:06', 1, 16),

As the Los Angeles Lakers are Leonard‚Äôs preferred destination, one intriguing scenario involves him, LeBron James and Paul George teaming up. </br> </br>\r\n\r\nWith the Lakers having necessary salary cap space to sign both James and George in free agency, they have previously are said to have informed teams no player is considered untouchable. As a result, the Lakers can put together an attractive trade offer for Leonard. \r\n\r\nor the Spurs, they are in unfamiliar territory as the NBA‚Äôs model franchise.

Although they have struck out in free agency in recent years, Leonard now joins George as players who want to play in Los Angeles.\r\n</br>\r\nWhile it would be difficult to part with the team‚Äôs young core, president of basketball operations Magic Johnson and general manager Rob Pelinka are looking to end their playoff drought and become a perennial championship contender once again.

(5, 'Who could Sixers target in top 5 of 2018 NBA draft?', '\r\nLuka Doncic is one of the most accomplished NBA Draft prospects ever, having led the best non-NBA team in the world to a championship while snatching the league MVP, championship MVP, and dubbing the name ‚ÄúWonder Boy‚Äù by 19 years of age. He‚Äôs put up unprecedented numbers in Liga ACB and EuroLeague for someone his age, thriving while playing among full grown adults rather than college kids\r\n\r\n<h1> Luka Doncic, G/F, Real Madrid (6-8/228) </h1>\r\nDoncic would make a ton of sense for the Sixers. The Slovenian wing is known for his elite playmaking ability. He‚Äôs an excellent ball handler and has an incredible offensive feel for a player his age. He also played in the second-best league in the world and excelled, taking home MVP of the EuroLeague at just 19 years old. <br> <br>\r\n\r\nThe biggest concerns will be his lack of elite athleticism and a somewhat inconsistent jumper. His lack of athleticism shows on drives to the basket and when he‚Äôs asked to guard smaller, quicker players. That could be an issue with the Sixers, who switch on everything. The jumper is there (80 percent free throw shooter as a pro), he just needs to show more consistency with it. <br><br>\r\n\r\nIt‚Äôd be interesting to see what Doncic can do with a big man like Embiid and a point guard with Simmons‚Äô vision. Doncic‚Äôs ability in the pick-and-roll could be lethal when paired with a player like Embiid. His overall offensive feel should help take some pressure off Simmons as a ball handler. If Markelle Fultz develops into the player the Sixers hoped, there‚Äôs no reason to think Doncic can‚Äôt play alongside the 2017 No. 1 overall pick. <br><br>\r\n\r\nIt‚Äôs also worth noting Doncic‚Äôs draft stock has slipped every-so-slightly recently ‚Äî he was projected to go No. 1 or 2 when the process started ‚Äî over fears of his ability to adjust to NBA athletes. The Sixers could be gauging to see where he slips and pounce. If I were a betting man ‚Äî I‚Äôm not ‚Äî my money would be on Doncic as the player they‚Äôre targeting. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<h1> Michael Porter Jr., F, Missouri, (6-10/211) </h1>\r\nLike Doncic, Porter Jr. is a bit of an enigma but for a different reason. Porter Jr., considered by many to be the top recruit coming out of high school, suffered a back injury that required a microdiscectomy on his L3-L4 spinal discs. He was only able to play in three games at Missouri and clearly lacked explosiveness.<br><br>\r\n\r\nPorter Jr. may be a better fit than Doncic from a basketball standpoint. Porter Jr. has a smooth shooting stroke, which is his most translatable NBA skill. He‚Äôs good both off the dribble and in catch-and-shoot opportunities. He‚Äôs also a good cutter and is better at playing off the ball. With his length, quickness and athleticism, he‚Äôd fit with what the Sixers do defensively with the ability to guard multiple positions. <br><br>\r\n\r\nWhile his shot should be there at the next level, he still has work to do on the rest of his offensive game. He doesn‚Äôt have great vision or feel and his handle will need to tighten up. Defensively, he lacks grit and physicality. He‚Äôs a poor rebounder for his size as well. There have also been questions about his maturity and whether he‚Äôs a good teammate. <br><br>\r\n\r\nWith news that Porter Jr. had to cancel a pre-draft workout because of hip spasms, the injury history is a little scary. With that said, reports say his medical records are fairly clean. Given the Sixers‚Äô recent history with injured draft picks, they‚Äôre kind of uniquely qualified to handle the situation. On the court, he should provide spacing for Embiid and Simmons with pot ential to grow on both ends of the floor. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<h1> Marvin Bagley, F/C, Duke (6-11/234) </h1>\r\nBagley is sort of the dark horse here. Before the college season began, it was either Porter Jr. or Bagley that most considered to be the best player out of high school. Bagley is probably the safest bet of these three players after finishing an outstanding freshman season at Duke, winning ACC Player of the Year with a clean bill of health. He may also be the oddest fit for the Sixers. <br><br>\r\n\r\nBagley is an outstanding athlete with great basketball instincts. He has the potential to have a strong jumper, shooting well from three (40 percent), but with a small sample size (58 attempts). He‚Äôs an outstanding rebounder (11.1) and plays hard and aggressively on defense. He excels in the pick and roll. He has a quick first step and has the potential to be a strong driver and finisher at the next level. <br><br>\r\n\r\nBagley‚Äôs biggest issue is that he‚Äôs kind of a tweener. He lacks the length and girth to play the five and may not be a strong enough shooter to be a modern NBA four. He‚Äôs a little too left-hand dependent with his drives and finishes. He‚Äôs more a strong team defender than an on-the-ball one. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Sixers are already set at center and arguably at the four with Dario Saric coming off a strong sophomore campaign and Jonah Bolden possibly coming from overseas. But Bagley could help in a few different scenarios. If the roster stays as is, Bagley could fight Bolden for minutes as a backup four and five. Saric is also a very attractive trade piece. If he‚Äôs moved in any type of deal, Bagley could be his replacement. Although it‚Äôs worth noting that if Saric is moved for a veteran piece, the Sixers will likely include the No. 10 pick in that deal and not move up. Bagley seems like the most unrealistic player to move up for, but you never know.<br><br>', 'assets/posts/nba-draft-top-pick-race.jpg', '2018-06-18 22:51:21', 1, 16),

(10, 'Trade packages that could land the Lakers Kawhi Leonard', 'The years of suffering might finally be coming to an end. According to multiple reports, San Antonio Spurs All-Star Kawhi Leonard wants a trade out of San Antonio, and the Los Angeles Lakers are his preferred destination. </br></br>\r\n\r\nThis isn‚Äôt the first time an All-Star small forward in his mid-20s has tried to force a trade to Los Angeles, but the Lakers have every reason to pull the trigger on a trade this year. With Paul George and LeBron James looking for a new place to call home, a trade for Leonard could make the Lakers an immediate favorite, even more so than they are now. </br></br>\r\n\r\nWith the 2018 NBA Draft less than a week away, a trade would likely have to be done sooner rather than later, going with the safe assumption that picks from this year‚Äôs draft would be involved.</br></br>\r\n\r\nHere are a few trade packages that the Lakers could put together to peak R.C. Buford‚Äôs interest.</br>\r\n\r\n<h1>Best-case</h1>\r\n\r\nLakers get: Kawhi Leonard </br></br>\r\n\r\nSpurs get: Luol Deng, Brandon Ingram, 2018 first-round pick (via CLE), 2019 first-round pick </br></br>\r\n\r\nIf you were expecting none of these trades to include one or more of your favorite players on the current roster, I‚Äôm sorry I have to be the one to tell you that just isn‚Äôt possible. Even in the best-case scenario, the Lakers would have to bid farewell to at least one of their promising young players. </br></br>\r\n\r\nGiven that the Spurs would be trading their starting small forward, it‚Äôs safe to assume the starting point to any talks will be Ingram. </br></br>\r\n\r\nThe No. 2 pick in the 2016 draft, Ingram hasn‚Äôt broken out the way some of the other rookies in his draft class have, like Jaylen Brown and Ben Simmons. However, in his sophomore season with the Lakers, Ingram showed flashes of being someone who can be a nightmare on both ends if he puts the work in.</br></br>\r\n\r\nParting with Ingram before he develops into the player fans were hoping he‚Äôd be will sting, but when you‚Äôre getting a player of Leonard‚Äôs caliber in return, those tears dry on their own. </br></br>\r\n\r\n <h1> ‚ÄúRealistic‚Äù </h1>\r\n\r\nLakers gets: Kawhi Leonard </br></br>\r\n\r\nSpurs get: Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma, Luol Deng, 2018 first-round pick (via CLE), 2019 second-round pick (via CHI)</br>\r\n\r\nIf you weren‚Äôt a fan of the first trade, you might want to sit down for this one.</br></br>\r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge in making any trade with the Spurs for Leonard is going to be matching salaries. The easiest way to do this is by throwing Luol Deng as salary filler, but even for a team that‚Äôs seemingly headed for a rebuild like the Spurs, Deng‚Äôs contract, which is guaranteed for $36 million through 2020 is a tough pill to swallow. </br></br>\r\n\r\nIn order to soften the blow, the Lakers would likely have to send more than one of their brightest youngsters, including the aforementioned Ingram and Kyle Kuzma, who the Spurs were reportedly high on leading up to the draft last year. </br></br>\r\n\r\nKuzma shattered any and all expectations for him in his rookie season and it doesn‚Äôt look like he plans on slowing down any time soon. Even at 22 years old, it‚Äôs not impractical to think Kuzma is nowhere near his ceiling and if the Lakers are lucky, the Spurs are thinking the same thing. </br></br>\r\n\r\nAgain, it‚Äôs not going to be easy to come to terms with the fact that both Ingram and Kuzma could be playing for another team next season, but if it means landing both Paul George and LeBron James, it‚Äôs worth it. </br></br>\r\n\r\n<h1> Worst-case </h1>\r\n\r\nLakers get: Kawhi Leonard, 2018 first-round pick </br></br>\r\n\r\nSpurs get: Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma, Josh Hart, Luol Deng, 2018 first-round pick </br></br>\r\n\r\nI should preface this trade by saying this isn‚Äôt technically the worst-case scenario. The worst-case scenario would involve the Lakers trading Lonzo Ball with no solid backup plan at point guard, unless you consider Tyler Ennis a solid backup plan. </br></br>\r\n\r\nIf that is the case for you, dear reader, I strongly suggest you seek help. My DMs are open (@RadRivas). </br></br>\r\n\r\nBut giving up not one, not two, but three players on rookie contracts for a player that can leave in a year is a risky move, even if it means getting out of a bad contract. </br></br>\r\n\r\nNo, Ingram, Kuzma, nor Hart can hold a candle to what Leonard has accomplished in his seven-year career, but teams with no depth don‚Äôt usually don‚Äôt fare well deep in the playoffs. Just ask the Cleveland Cavaliers, or the Oklahoma City Thunder. </br></br>\r\n\r\nNow that the season is over, the Lakers and the Spurs can start negotiating trades immediately. However, it‚Äôs possible the Spurs are holding out on hope that Gregg Popovich and Leonard can reach an armistice of sorts following their meeting, which reportedly has not yet happened. </br></br>\r\n\r\nIf the two parties can‚Äôt reach an agreement, you can bet on Rob Pelinka shooting ‚ÄúYou up?‚Äù texts to Buford and Co. until a deal is done, even if trading Leonard to the Lakers isn‚Äôt the Spurs‚Äô top option.</br></br>', 'assets/posts/usa_today_10701082.0.jpg', '2018-06-19 01:51:28', 0, 16),

The one hole in what is a mostly loaded roster, though, is in the middle. </br></br>\r\n\r\nAnd while there have been ample rumors in the past year about Boston chasing the likes of Anthony Davis and Karl-Anthony Towns, the answer could be slightly different: Texas center Mo Bamba, who is expected to be one of the top picks in this year‚Äôs draft.</br></br>\r\n\r\nSources told Sporting News that Boston has expressed interest in Bamba, including interviewing him at the Chicago pre-draft combine two weeks ago. Bamba measured in with a record wingspan of 7-10 in Chicago, reinforcing his status as the most ready-made rim protector in the draft.</br></br>\r\n\r\nOf course, the challenge is securing a pick that will be high enough to land Bamba. He could go as high as No. 3 to the Hawks, and there has also been talk that the Magic ‚Äî picking sixth ‚Äî are high on Bamba and won‚Äôt let him drop past their slot.</br></br>\r\n\r\nThe Celtics have the No. 27 pick, but they have multiple assets on hand that could help them move into the top five of the draft, where the Grizzlies (No. 4) and Mavericks (No. 5) have made it clear they‚Äôre willing to make a deal.</br></br>\r\n\r\nIt‚Äôs almost certain that the Celtics would not move rookie forward Jayson Tatum, who just wrapped up the postseason as the team‚Äôs leading scorer, at 18.5 points per game. Less certain, though, is what Boston might do with point guard Terry Rozier (16.5 points, 5.7 assists and 5.3 rebounds per game in the playoffs) or swingman Jaylen Brown (18.0 points per game in the playoffs).</br></br>\r\n\r\nThe Celtics were without star point guard Kyrie Irving in the playoffs and major free-agent signee Gordon Hayward for all but the first five minutes of the season. Both players will return, reducing the the roles of players like Rozier and Brown.</br></br>\r\n\r\nTeam president Danny Ainge has been aggressive in his attempts to build the Celtics into a championship-caliber team, so even as Rozier and Brown have become fan favorites, a deal involving either (or both) is not out of the question.</br></br>\r\n\r\nIn order to move into the top five of the draft, the Celtics would likely have to give up either Rozier or Brown ‚Äî Dallas (Dennis Smith Jr.) and Memphis (Mike Conley) already have point guards, and would almost certainly prefer Brown. </br></br>\r\n\r\nAnd Boston probably would have to include this year‚Äôs draft pick, as well as at least one pick next year, when the Celtics own Sacramento‚Äôs pick (protected for the first overall pick) as well as Memphis‚Äô pick (top-eight protected). </br></br>\r\n\r\nBut the Celtics have a near-complete roster. A rim protector like Bamba ‚Äî who has also shown flashes of offensive improvement heading into the draft ‚Äî could be a solid finishing touch. </br></br>\r\n', 'assets/posts/mohamed-bamba-ftr-021318jpg_crsg9mdqbttz1c65q1ty6wb5w.jpg', '2018-06-19 01:56:48', 0, 16),
(12, '2018 NBA Draft roundtable: Should the Atlanta Hawks attempt to trade down from No. 3 overall?', 'The 2018 NBA Draft is nearly here and, before it arrives on June 21, the Peachtree Hoops staff gathered in roundtable fashion to answer a few pertinent questions. In the fourth installment, the panel considers the looming question surrounding whether the Atlanta Hawks should consider accepting an offer to move down from No. 3 overall. </br></br>\r\n\r\n<strong>Brad Rowland:\r\n</strong> It‚Äôs tough. This is a draft in which the Hawks need to come away with a premium asset and, at least on my personal board, there is a four-player top tier. With that said, a player like Trae Young could easily be seen as a top-tier talent (with unquestionably high upside) and, if Atlanta has a longer tier than I do at the top, a good way to find added value would be to slide back a spot or two in pursuit of additional assets. It‚Äôs impossible without knowing exactly what they can get but nothing should be OFF the table at this point, even if it would take a lot to justify this kind of move.</br></br>\r\n\r\n<strong>Jeff Siegel:</strong>  If they do, it should only be a few spots. Trading down significantly, say for the Clippers‚Äô No. 12 and No. 13 picks, plus a future asset, puts them one year behind on getting a potential superstar, most of whom come at the top of the draft. If a team like Dallas or Orlando bowls them over with an offer to move down from No. 3 to No. 5 or 6, then that makes more sense, but my board differs from Brad‚Äôs in that way; I have Doncic in a tier by himself at the top, then six or seven players in the next group below him, all with their strengths and weaknesses.</br></br>\r\n\r\n<strong>Graham Chapple:</strong>  It really depends on who the Hawks are targeting. I‚Äôm sure they have a very rough idea who they want to select with that third pick by this stage. Someone like Marvin Bagley III probably isn‚Äôt going to be available after No. 3 or No. 4, should the Hawks trade down. If Atlanta are OK with that -- and they‚Äôre targeting someone like Trae Young, Mo Bamba or Michael Porter Jr. instead -- then they should explore what package is available for them to do that and if the returns are that where it‚Äôs in Atlanta‚Äôs interest. Would I do it? No, probably not but, of course, it all depends on the offer that comes in. The Hawks are in a great spot regardless -- one of Ayton, Doncic or Bagley/Jackson are in their grasp at No. 3 and they can gauge offers from other teams about moving up. A great position to be in. </br></br>\r\n\r\n', 'assets/posts/usa_today_10706248.0.jpg', '2018-06-19 02:00:38', 0, 16),

While the Cleveland Cavaliers might not capitalize on those rumors, they should capitalize on this one, but only under the right circumstances. </br></br>\r\n\r\nPer The Athletic, the Memphis Grizzlies have been open to trading the No. 4 overall pick. </br></br>\r\n\r\n    The Memphis Grizzlies have gauged the trade market on a package of Chandler Parsons and the No. 4 overall pick, league sources told The Athletic. </br></br>\r\n\r\n    Parsons, who has missed 94 combined games over the past two seasons, is owed $49.2 million guaranteed over the next two seasons. </br></br>\r\n\r\nNBADraft.net has the Grizzlies taking Jaren Jackson Jr. with the No. 4 overall. Clearly, one of two ideas are catching steam in the Grizzlies front office. Either they are really not impressed with any prospect outside of the top three. Or, they really do plan to hit 50+ wins next season like their owner said they would. </br></br>\r\n\r\nI think it‚Äôs easy to assume that it‚Äôs the latter. </br></br>\r\n\r\nCombining the pick and Parsons would do two things. It would allow Memphis to free up enough cap to possibly sign a player like DeMarcus Cousins or Aaron Gordan. Then, on top of signing a big name free agent, they‚Äôll have an all-star level talent that they traded their pick for. </br></br>\r\n\r\nThink about rolling out a lineup with Mike Conley, Aaron Godran, DeMarcus Cousins, and Kevin Love.

Now Kawhi Leonard wants out of San Antonio, and according to ESPN‚Äôs Adrian Wojnarowski, his preferred destination is in Los Angeles with the Lakers. That‚Äôs the same place James owns two homes, and the same place George has not-so-subtly been angling to play. </br></br>\r\n\r\n<h1>Renounce all of their free agents</h1>\r\n\r\nThe Lakers currently project to have more cap space available than any other team for the upcoming free agency period. The cap is currently projected to come in at $101 million, giving the Lakers about $66 million in cap space, according to Spotrac. </br></br>\r\n\r\nBut to get there, they have to sever ties with their free-agents-to-be. That means Los Angeles has to renounce their rights to Julius Randle ‚Äî allowing the talented forward to become an unrestricted free agent this summer ‚Äî as well as Brook Lopez, Isaiah Thomas, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Channing Frye, Andre Ingram, and Travis Wear. Tyler Ennis, Ivica Zubac, and Thomas Bryant have small non-guaranteed contracts that can be released as well. It doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt re-sign these players; Los Angeles just won‚Äôt be able to exceed the salary cap with more than a minimum contract to re-sign them. </br></br>\r\n\r\nIf they renounce everyone as expected, Los Angeles would have about $37 million in guaranteed salaries committed for the 2018-19 season. </br></br>\r\n\r\nYes, it would come at the cost of parting ways with Randle, but his name has been swirling in trade rumors for years. Losing him for a chance at landing three superstars is a no-brainer. </br></br>\r\n\r\nIn order to hit that $34.56 million cap mark, the Lakers would also need to trade the No. 25 pick in  this year‚Äôs draft to free themselves of the cap hold of 120 percent of the rookie scale contract.

During the regular season, Damian averaged almost 27 points per game and performed countless late-game heroics to lift Portland during close affairs. However, the playoffs this year proved that whatever they are doing up there in Oregon is not going to be enough for Lillard to take another step forward in his career. </br></br>\r\n\r\nThis is why we believe that it wouldn‚Äôt be too farfetched to imagine this guy demanding a trade just like Kyrie Irving that last year. </br></br>\r\n\r\n<i><b>Yes, he is their franchise player, but there is not much Portland could do if he decided he did not want to play for them anymore.</b></i></br></br>\r\n\r\nAnd in a way, maybe they could get some valuable pieces going forward if they decided to trade the guy. After all, Lillard was terrible during the playoffs, as he averaged a little over 18 points per game while shooting an abysmal 35 percent from the field.</br></br>\r\n\r\nAs for where he could go, there have been whispers this offseason that the Suns are interested in Lillard, but what they could give up is another story.
